1) If Thread is dead we cannot restart it.
2) You have to create new Thread.

In Java a Thread object can be started only once.
Once the run() method has finished, the thread enters the terminated state and the JVM will throw an IllegalThreadStateException if you try to start it again.
To run the same task a second time you must create a new Thread (or a new task in a threadâ€‘pool).
