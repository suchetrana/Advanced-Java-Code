# What is Comparable?

Comparable is an interface that is used to define a natural ordering of objects.
When a class implements the Comparable interface, it means that instances of that class can be sorted in a natural way.

The natural ordering is defined by the `compareTo()` method, which is used to compare the current object with another object of the same class.

The `compareTo()` method returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer depending on whether the current object is less than, equal to, or greater than the other object.

# What is Comparator?

Comparator is an interface that is used to define a custom ordering of objects. When a class implements the Comparator interface, it means that instances of that class can be sorted in a custom way.

The custom ordering is defined by the `compare()` method, which is used to compare two objects of the same class.

The `compare()` method returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer depending on whether the first object is less than, equal to, or greater than the second object.


This method compares two objects, o1 and o2, and returns:

-1 (or any negative number): if o1 should come before o2
0: if o1 and o2 are equal in sorting order
1 (or any positive number): if o1 should come after o2


 Easy Way to Remember:

Negative (-1) → First comes before second
Zero (0) → Both are equal
Positive (1) → First comes after second
